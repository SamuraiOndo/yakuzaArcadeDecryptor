decrypts sega ages roms in the yakuza games. built with yakuza 7 in mind but might work for other games. 
no support for re-encrypting the files, however, i have developed a way to run the decrypted roms in game so it is possible to run custom roms. possibly. will elaborate later.

code is bad, sorry, but im sure you can get the gist of whats being done
can also look at the "ArcadeTestDLL_InitRom" function in the arcade dll of yakuza 7 if you wanna reverse it yourself.
